It is\n\t\t * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n\t\t * your questions.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n\t\t * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n\t\t *\n\t\t * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n\t\t *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n\t\t *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n\t\t *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n\t\t *\n\t\t * So what to do?  The is the best:\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n\t\t *\n\t\t * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n\t\t * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n\t\t *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n\t\t *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n\t\t *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n\t\t * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n\t\t * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n\t\t * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n\t\t * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n\t\t * linear speed or acceleration.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n\t\t *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n\t\t *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n\t\t *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n\t\t *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n\t\t *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n\t\t *     pixels!\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n\t\t *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n\t\t *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n\t\t *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n\t\t *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n\t\t *     you know.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Implementation info:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n\t\t * average mouse:\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t\t *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n\t\t *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n\t\t *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t\t *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t\t *\n\t\t * On the trackpad:\n\t\t *\n\t\t *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n\t\t *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n\t\t *\n\t\t * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n\t\t * also missing delta values.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n\t\t *\n\t\t * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n\t\t * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n\t\t * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n\t\t * better normalize spin speed.

It is\n\t * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n\t * your questions.\n\t *\n\t * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n\t * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n\t *\n\t * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n\t *\n\t *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n\t *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n\t *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n\t *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n\t *\n\t * So what to do?  The is the best:\n\t *\n\t *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n\t *\n\t * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n\t * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n\t *\n\t *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n\t *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n\t *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n\t *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n\t *\n\t * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n\t * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n\t * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n\t * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n\t * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n\t * linear speed or acceleration.\n\t *\n\t * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n\t *\n\t *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n\t *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n\t *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n\t *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n\t *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n\t *\n\t *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n\t *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n\t *     pixels!\n\t *\n\t *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n\t *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n\t *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n\t *\n\t * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n\t *\n\t *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n\t *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n\t *\n\t *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n\t *\n\t *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n\t *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n\t *     you know.\n\t *\n\t * Implementation info:\n\t *\n\t * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n\t * average mouse:\n\t *\n\t *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n\t *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n\t *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n\t *\n\t * On the trackpad:\n\t *\n\t *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n\t *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n\t *\n\t * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n\t * also missing delta values.\n\t *\n\t * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n\t *\n\t * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n\t *\n\t * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n\t * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n\t * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n\t * better normalize spin speed.  Example of what the browsers provide:\n\t *\n\t *                          | event.wheelDelta | event.detail\n\t *        ------------------+------------------+--------------\n\t *          Safari v5/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n\t *          Safari v5/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n\t *         Chrome v17/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n\t *         Chrome v17/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n\t *                IE9/Win7  |       -120       |   undefined\n\t *         Firefox v4/OS X  |     undefined    |       1\n\t *         Firefox v4/Win7  |     undefined    |       3\n\t *\n\t */\n\tfunction normalizeWheel( /*object*/event) /*object*/{\n\t  var sX = 0,\n\t      sY = 0,\n\t      // spinX, spinY\n\t  pX = 0,\n\t      pY = 0; // pixelX, pixelY\n\n\t  // Legacy\n\t  if ('detail' in event) {\n\t    sY = event.detail;\n\t  }\n\t  if ('wheelDelta' in event) {\n\t    sY = -event.wheelDelta / 120;\n\t  }\n\t  if ('wheelDeltaY' in event) {\n\t    sY = -event.wheelDeltaY / 120;\n\t  }\n\t  if ('wheelDeltaX' in event) {\n\t    sX = -event.wheelDeltaX / 120;\n\t  }\n\n\t  // side scrolling on FF with DOMMouseScroll\n\t  if ('axis' in event && event.axis === event.HORIZONTAL_AXIS) {\n\t    sX = sY;\n\t    sY = 0;\n\t  }\n\n\t  pX = sX * PIXEL_STEP;\n\t  pY = sY * PIXEL_STEP;\n\n\t  if ('deltaY' in event) {\n\t    pY = event.deltaY;\n\t  }\n\t  if ('deltaX' in event) {\n\t    pX = event.deltaX;\n\t  }\n\n\t  if ((pX || pY) && event.deltaMode) {\n\t    if (event.deltaMode == 1) {\n\t      // delta in LINE units\n\t      pX *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n\t      pY *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n\t    } else {\n\t      // delta in PAGE units\n\t      pX *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n\t      pY *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\n\t  // Fall-back if spin cannot be determined\n\t  if (pX && !sX) {\n\t    sX = pX < 1 ? -1 : 1;\n\t  }\n\t  if (pY && !sY) {\n\t    sY = pY < 1 ? -1 : 1;\n\t  }\n\n\t  return { spinX: sX,\n\t    spinY: sY,\n\t    pixelX: pX,\n\t    pixelY: pY };\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * The best combination if you prefer spinX + spinY normalization.
